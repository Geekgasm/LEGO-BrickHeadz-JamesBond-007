# LEGO BrickHeadz James Bond 007

## Build your own James Bond LEGO BrickHeadz!

I built this MOC after I was finished with the official James Bond Aston Martin DB5 LEGO set (10262) and felt there was something missing.

So I grabbed the wonderful Go Brick Me set (41597) and started building a little double-O agent.

I had to add some black parts and the gun from my collection, and I hand-drew the tie and coronation on Mr. Bond's jacket.

I shared the picture on Twitter and Instagram with the "official" hashtag #LicenseToBuild which was promoted by the LEGO Group for tagging pictures of the DB5.

The good people of LEGO social media liked my build so much that they asked if they could post it on the official LEGO channels. Of course I said yes!

## Building Instructions

Some people were asking for instructions on how to build the little guy, so I modeled him in Studio, the awesome virtual LEGO 3D building tool, which was developed by the awesome Bricklink people.

Several files are provided in this repository:

* [BrickHeadz 007.io](BrickHeadz%20007.io) is the full Studio 2.0 file.
* [BrickHeadz 007.pdf](BrickHeadz%20007.pdf) are the PDF instructions generated with Studio.
* [BrickHeadz James Bond 007 Parts Bricklink.xml](BrickHeadz%20James%20Bond%20007%20Parts%20Bricklink.xml) is the parts list with all the needed parts (except for the the decorations), which you can upload to Bricklink as a wishlist to try and source the parts.

**Happy building!**
